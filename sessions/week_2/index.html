		<p>The recent UN Climate Action Summit in New York was a marathon of presentations (pdf) by scientists, activists, and policy wonks sharing ideas on how to save our beleaguered planet. But of the many who spoke, it was Olafur Eliasson, a celebrated Danish-Icelandic artist, who had the most arresting slide deck.</p>

<p>The recently appointed UNDP goodwill ambassador had, in a sense, been accumulating material for his Sept. 26 lecture for years. His three-decade career has surfaced the marvelous yet overlooked qualities of light, water, and air. With his sensibility shaped by the dramatic vistas of Iceland and Denmark, his oeuvre is evidence of how public art can foster “a felt understanding of the challenges at hand,” as he puts it.</p>

<p>Eschewing the hard-hitting bullet points, pithy slogans, and data graphics of many slide decks, Eliasson’s presentation, like his art, was a masterclass in eliciting an audience’s awe and curiosity.</p>

		<p>He began with images of “Ice Watch,” a project that involved him working with a geologist and transporting 12 glacial ice blocks from outside Greenland to the center of Paris. Timed for the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, the “sculptures” were arranged in a circle to symbolize how little time we have to act on climate change. It was a poetic spectacle, accompanied by a report (pdf) about the installation’s CO2 impact.</p>

<p>“I think a lot if people realized that they were looking at 15,000, maybe 25,000 years of frozen water,” he said, noting that the act of  touching the ice might result in a deeper concern about the rapidly disappearing Greenland ice caps and sea level rise. “If you put your ear to the glacier, you can actually hear many sounds,” Eliasson said, referring to the popping of air bubbles as the ice melts. “These micro-relationships are interesting. To take all the data, news, and scientific papers and turn it into something you can touch is I think incredibly affective.”</p>
